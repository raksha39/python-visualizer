  <p align="center">
  <i><b>A desktop application built using Tkinter and Pygame to visualize various searchin and sorting algorithms. This project aims to provide an intuitive understanding of sorting algorithms for beginners and enthusiasts alike.<br/>
  Users can select from different sorting algorithms and visualize how they work step by step. The goal is to enhance learning through visual representation.<br/>
  Contributions to improve this project are always welcome!</b></i>

## Algorithms Included
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

### Main Window
The main window features a dropdown menu for selecting the sorting algorithm and a button to start the visualization. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to understand how sorting algorithms operate.

### Sorting Visualization
Once an algorithm is selected, the visualization window displays the sorting process in real-time. Users can see how elements are compared and swapped, providing a clear understanding of each algorithm's mechanics.

## Requirements/Steps to Run
1. Install [*__Python__*](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`
3. Run `main.py` to start the application.

## Future Additions / Upgrades
* Add more sorting algorithms
* Implement sound effects during sorting
* Include options for different array sizes and types
* Enhance the visualization with more detailed animations
